/* The Redis HyperLogLog implementation is based on the following ideas:
 *
 * * The use of a 64 bit hash function as proposed in [1], in order to estimate
 *   cardinalities larger than 10^9, at the cost of just 1 additional bit per
 *   register.
 * * The use of 16384 6-bit registers for a great level of accuracy, using
 *   a total of 12k per key.
 * * The use of the Redis string data type. No new type is introduced.
 * * No attempt is made to compress the data structure as in [1]. Also the
 *   algorithm used is the original HyperLogLog Algorithm as in [2], with
 *   the only difference that a 64 bit hash function is used, so no correction
 *   is performed for values near 2^32 as in [1].
 *
 * [1] Heule, Nunkesser, Hall: HyperLogLog in Practice: Algorithmic
 *     Engineering of a State of The Art Cardinality Estimation Algorithm.
 *
 * [2] P. Flajolet, Ã‰ric Fusy, O. Gandouet, and F. Meunier. Hyperloglog: The
 *     analysis of a near-optimal cardinality estimation algorithm.
 *
 * Redis uses two representations:
 *
 * 1) A "dense" representation where every entry is represented by
 *    a 6-bit integer.
 * 2) A "sparse" representation using run length compression suitable
 *    for representing HyperLogLogs with many registers set to 0 in
 *    a memory efficient way.
 *
 *
 * HLL header
 * ===
 *
 * The dense representation have a 9 byte header as follows:
 *
 *               +---------+---+
 *               | Cardin. | E |
 *               +---------+---+
 * 
 * The sparse representation have a 13 byte header as follows:
 *
 * +-----+-------+---------+---+
 * | Len | Alloc | Cardin. | E |
 * +-----+-------+---------+---+
 *
 * "Len" for sparse representation is a 2 byte value indicates to the
 *  length of the data following the header.
 * "Alloc" for sparse representation is a 2 byte value indicates to the 
 * allocated size for data.
 * For dense representation, length of the data is a fixed value. 
 * For both representation, "E" is one byte encoding, currently set to 
 * HLL_DENSE or HLL_SPARSE. 
 *
 * The "Cardin." field is a 64 bit integer stored in little endian format
 * with the latest cardinality computed that can be reused if the data
 * structure was not modified since the last computation (this is useful
 * because there are high probabilities that HLLADD operations don't
 * modify the actual data structure and hence the approximated cardinality).
 *
 * When the most significant bit in the most significant byte of the cached
 * cardinality is set, it means that the data structure was modified and
 * we can't reuse the cached value that must be recomputed.
 *
 * Dense representation
 * ===
 *
 * The dense representation used by Redis is the following:
 *
 * +--------+--------+--------+------//      //--+
 * |11000000|22221111|33333322|55444444 ....     |
 * +--------+--------+--------+------//      //--+
 *
 * The 6 bits counters are encoded one after the other starting from the
 * LSB to the MSB, and using the next bytes as needed.
 *
 * Sparse representation
 * ===
 *
 * The sparse representation encodes registers using a run length
 * encoding composed of three opcodes, two using one byte, and one using
 * of two bytes. The opcodes are called ZERO, XZERO and VAL.
 *
 * ZERO opcode is represented as 00xxxxxx. The 6-bit integer represented
 * by the six bits 'xxxxxx', plus 1, means that there are N registers set
 * to 0. This opcode can represent from 1 to 64 contiguous registers set
 * to the value of 0.
 *
 * XZERO opcode is represented by two bytes 01xxxxxx yyyyyyyy. The 14-bit
 * integer represented by the bits 'xxxxxx' as most significant bits and
 * 'yyyyyyyy' as least significant bits, plus 1, means that there are N
 * registers set to 0. This opcode can represent from 0 to 16384 contiguous
 * registers set to the value of 0.
 *
 * VAL opcode is represented as 1vvvvvxx. It contains a 5-bit integer
 * representing the value of a register, and a 2-bit integer representing
 * the number of contiguous registers set to that value 'vvvvv'.
 * To obtain the value and run length, the integers vvvvv and xx must be
 * incremented by one. This opcode can represent values from 1 to 32,
 * repeated from 1 to 4 times.
 *
 * The sparse representation can't represent registers with a value greater
 * than 32, however it is very unlikely that we find such a register in an
 * HLL with a cardinality where the sparse representation is still more
 * memory efficient than the dense representation. When this happens the
 * HLL is converted to the dense representation.
 *
 * The sparse representation is purely positional. For example a sparse
 * representation of an empty HLL is just: XZERO:16384.
 *
 * An HLL having only 3 non-zero registers at position 1000, 1020, 1021
 * respectively set to 2, 3, 3, is represented by the following three
 * opcodes:
 *
 * XZERO:1000 (Registers 0-999 are set to 0)
 * VAL:2,1    (1 register set to value 2, that is register 1000)
 * ZERO:19    (Registers 1001-1019 set to 0)
 * VAL:3,2    (2 registers set to value 3, that is registers 1020,1021)
 * XZERO:15362 (Registers 1022-16383 set to 0)
 *
 * In the example the sparse representation used just 7 bytes instead
 * of 12k in order to represent the HLL registers. In general for low
 * cardinality there is a big win in terms of space efficiency, traded
 * with CPU time since the sparse representation is slower to access:
 *
 * The following table shows average cardinality vs bytes used, 100
 * samples per cardinality (when the set was not representable because
 * of registers with too big value, the dense representation size was used
 * as a sample).
 *
 * 100 267
 * 200 485
 * 300 678
 * 400 859
 * 500 1033
 * 600 1205
 * 700 1375
 * 800 1544
 * 900 1713
 * 1000 1882
 * 2000 3480
 * 3000 4879
 * 4000 6089
 * 5000 7138
 * 6000 8042
 * 7000 8823
 * 8000 9500
 * 9000 10088
 * 10000 10591
 *
 * The dense representation uses 12288 bytes, so there is a big win up to
 * a cardinality of ~2000-3000. For bigger cardinalities the constant times
 * involved in updating the sparse representation is not justified by the
 * memory savings. The exact maximum length of the sparse representation
 * when this implementation switches to the dense representation is
 * configured via the define server.hll_sparse_max_bytes.
